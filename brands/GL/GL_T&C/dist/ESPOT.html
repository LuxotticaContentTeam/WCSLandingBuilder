            <p>THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION.</p>
            <ul class="ct_li__letter">
              <li>You and Luxottica each agree that any and all disputes or claims with or against any party that relate to or arise from this agreement, your use of or access to this website, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our website shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. The sole exceptions to this requirement are (a) either party may assert individual claims in small claims courts if those claims otherwise qualify for small claims court and as long as the matter remains in such court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction and (b) each party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate section (this “Agreement to Arbitrate”).</li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</strong><br>
                You and Luxottica agree that each of us may bring claims that relate to or arise from your use of or access to our website, any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services, or communications (including calls, texts, or emails) that relate to or arise from your use of or access to our website only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including but not limited to actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq., the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code § 630 et seq., the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS § 14/1 et seq.,Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, Bus. & Com. § 503.001 et seq., and other federal and state telemarketing and privacy laws. Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form if a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief, including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect our other users.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong>
                <ul class="ct_li__number">
                  <li>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.</li>
                  <li>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at http://www.adr.org.</li>
                  <li>If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</li>
                  <li>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>
                  <li>This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement to Arbitrate and the closing of your Account or your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services.</li>
                  <li>Costs of Arbitration<br>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law or the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Luxottica will pay all fees and costs that we are required to pay by law.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
                The arbitration proceedings and arbitration award shall be maintained by the parties as strictly confidential, except as is otherwise required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, vacate or enforce the award and for disclosure in confidence to the parties’ respective attorneys, tax advisors and senior management and to family members of a party who is an individual.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Severability</strong><br>
                <p>If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply, except if an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions under the subheading “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” of this Agreement to Arbitrate are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the Agreement will continue to apply.</p>
